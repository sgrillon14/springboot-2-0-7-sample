mongock is a java MongoDB tool for tracking, managing and applying database schema changes.

The motivation of this project is to add some important and useful features, provide a different code design, which we believe is easier to maintain, extend and debug, applying what we believe are best practices, and specially providing a more fluent maintenance to apply collaborator's contributions. The concept is very similar to other db migration tools such as Liquibase or Flyway but without using XML/JSON/YML files.

mongock provides new approach for adding changes (change sets) based on Java classes and methods with appropriate annotations.
